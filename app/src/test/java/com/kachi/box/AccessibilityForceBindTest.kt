/**
 * WIRING/BOUNDARY contract for the accessibility FORCE-REBIND self-heal (docs/diagnostics/
 * oncar-handoff-voicekey-2026-08-14.md §8). The pure decision/string logic lives in
 * [com.kachi.box.modules.navaccess.AccessibilityRebind] in `:core` and is unit-tested there
 * ([com.kachi.box.modules.navaccess.AccessibilityRebindTest], device-free). This test — which sits in
 * `:app` because it inspects [KeyServiceConnect], an `:app` type that owns the dadb transport — proves that pure
 * logic is actually WIRED into the dadb grant path with the required safety guarantees, so the heal really
 * runs on-car after a reboot. Runtime behaviour needs the head unit, so, like the other contract tests, it
 * locks the wiring by reading the source across the boundary.
