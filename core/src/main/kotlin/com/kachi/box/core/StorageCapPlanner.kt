/**
 * Pure planner for capping a directory's total size — decides WHICH entries to delete (OLDEST first) so the
 * survivors fit under a byte cap. Android-free + filesystem-free so it is unit-tested off-car; the actual
 * enumeration + deletion (off-thread + degrade-safe) live in the app-side `com.kachi.box.DiagStorageCap`.
 *
 * WHY oldest-first: the diagnostic logs / per-frame arrow PNGs / segment screenshots are only useful for the
 * drive that produced them, so when the diagnostic files exceed the cap the OLDEST data is the least
 * valuable — evict it first, keep the freshest capture. This is a defensive backstop that runs even while
 * verbose data-collection is ON, so a single long drive can never fill the car's storage (the 7 GB+
 * nav_arrow_pngs / diag / CSV incident that motivated the cap).
 *
 * 2.92 (DIAG-CAP-USERDATA): "diagnostic files" means the [DiagFiles] allow-list ONLY — the same external dir
 * also holds user data (photos, wallpapers, car images, profile exports, side-loaded voice packs) that the cap
 * must never touch; see [selectDiagForDeletion].
