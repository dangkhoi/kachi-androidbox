/**
 * REUSABLE single-in-flight + cooldown guard (pure JVM, :core, unit-tested).
 *
 * ── Why (B6) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Generalizes the PROVEN on-car guard that [com.kachi.box.VietMapAutostart] uses (in-flight `AtomicBoolean`
 * CAS + a cooldown timestamp) so the launcher auto-start ([com.kachi.box.KachiAutostart]) reuses the SAME
 * algorithm WITHOUT duplicating the logic and WITHOUT touching the proven VietMap file. A burst of boot triggers
 * (BOOT_COMPLETED + MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED + a HOME relaunch in quick succession) then runs the setup at most once.
 *
 * The guard/decision is Android-free, so per LayeringRules it lives in :core (not :app). The Android side
 * ([com.kachi.box.KachiAutostart]) holds ONE instance and wraps [tryBegin]/[finish] in a `try/finally`.
 *
 * Idempotency here is w.r.t a SINGLE process (RAM latch). Durable, cross-process idempotency for the freeform
 * seed is a separate concern owned by [com.kachi.box.system.FreeformSeedPolicy]'s 3-state marker.
 *
 * @param cooldownMs minimum spacing between two runs; a claim inside the window (after the previous finished) is refused.
